            "body": "The Greatest was not only one of the best heavyweights of all time, he was also one of the most colorful. He won the gold medal at the 1960 Olympics and went on to become the first boxer to win the heavyweight title three times. Ali finished his career with a 56-5 record with 37 KOs. His most well-known fights include a trilogy with Joe Frazier including the 'Thrilla in Manila' and the 'Rumble in the Jungl' against George Foreman."

            "body": "Robinson was 85-0 as an amateur with 69 of those victories coming by way of knockout, 40 in the first round. He turned professional in 1940 at the age of 19 and by 1951 had a professional record of 128-1-2 with 84 knockouts. Robinson held the welterweight title from 1946 to 1951, and won the middleweight title in the latter year. He retired in 1952, only to come back two and a half years later and regain the middleweight title in 1955."
